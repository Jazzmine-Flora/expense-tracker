- **Font Awesome**: For icons.

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

After running `npm run deploy`, GitHub Pages must use the **gh-pages** branch, not the default branch. Otherwise the site will show the README instead of the app.

1. In your repo, go to **Settings** → **Pages**.
2. Under **Build and deployment** → **Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
3. Under **Branch**, select **gh-pages** and **/ (root)**.
4. Click **Save**. The site will update in 1–2 minutes.
